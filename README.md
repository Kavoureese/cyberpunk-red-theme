![Cyberpunk Red Theme using the Iosevka Font](./cyberpunk_red_theme.png)

# Cyberpunk Red Theme
This is a dark theme for Visual Studio Code based on Cyberpunk's 2077 red and cyan theme. It is heavily influenced by [this Cyberpunk Theme](https://github.com/prometheux-ar/cyberpunk). 
The goal of this theme is to be simple and minimal, with as few colors as possible. <br>
Realistically, it is not meant for most people but I always wanted to make a theme that perfectly fits my taste. And so I thought to share it here, for anyone interested.

# Usage
Clone this repository directly into the extensions folder of VS Code. <br> <br>
Recommended fonts: Fira Code or [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka).

# Project Scope
This is still a Work In Progress. <br>
It is only intended for the C and C++ languages. I don't plan on supporting other languages. <br>
There may be support for other file types, as I see fit.

# Current Status
Currently there is initial support for C. Not yet finalized. <br>
No work done at this point for C++.

# Contributing
This project is not intended to become large. So I will not be accepting Pull Requests, in order to preserve my vision. <br>
However, feel free to open issues for any bug you may encounter or for suggesting new colors/features. <br> <br>
Thank you!
